The catalog, which classified titles by subject, displayed an inventory of authors in consecutive order together with their published efforts. It has also been determined that the library employed a qualified librarian.\\n\\n\\n== India ==\\nThe great seats of learning in the ancient Indian subcontinent include:\\n\\nTakshasila (6th to 5th century BC in modern-day Pakistan),\\nNalanda (founded in 427) was considered \"one of the first great universities in recorded history\". In 1193, the Nalanda University complex was invaded and sacked by the Slave Dynasty under the Turkic Muslim general Bakhtiyar Khilji; this event is seen as a milestone in the decline of Buddhism in India.\\nVikramshila (8th century)\\nKanchipuram and other universities, also maintained vast libraries of palm leaf manuscripts on various subjects, ranging from theology to astronomy.\\n\\n\\n== Iran ==\\nThe Academy of Gondishapur in western Iran, established during the Persian Sassanid Empire in the 3rd through 6th centuries.The breadth of this institution was enormous and included a university, teaching hospital, and a library filled with over 400,000 titles. The academy was the epitome of the Sassanid Empire with its faculty highly proficient in the conventions of Zoroastrianism and ancient Persian as well as classical Indian scholarship.\\n\\n\\n== Iraq ==\\nThe Library of Ashurbanipal (established 668–627 BC) in Nineveh (near modern Mosul, Iraq)Long considered to be the first systematically collected library, was rediscovered in the 19th century. While the library had been destroyed, many fragments of the ancient cuneiform tablets survived, and have been reconstructed. Large portions of the Epic of Gilgamesh were among the many finds.\\nNippur temple library (2500 B.C.)The earliest version of the Great Flood was discovered here.\\nNuzi (Modern Yorgan Tepe) (1500 B.C.)This archive consisted of over 6,000 tablets written primarily in Babylonian cuneiform, however a select few were composed in the indigenous Hurrian language.\\nThe House of Wisdom (Baghdad) (9th–13th centuries)An Abbasid-era library and Arabic translation institute in Baghdad, Iraq. 8th century – 1258. The academy was expressed by not only the library, but a celestial observatory. There is a dearth of information on this institution and the majority of knowledge about it comes from the accounts of the Muslim scholar and bibliographer Ibn al-Nadim.\\n\\n\\n== Italy ==\\nLibraries of the Forum, consisted of separate libraries founded in the time of Augustus near the Roman Forum that contained both Greek and Latin texts, separately housed, as was the conventional practice. There were libraries in the Porticus Octaviae near the Theatre of Marcellus, in the temple of Apollo Palatinus, and in the Bibliotheca Ulpia in the Forum of Trajan.\\nAtrium Liberatatis public library of Asinius Pollio\\nThe Villa of the Papyri, in Herculaneum, ItalyThe only library known to have survived from classical antiquity. This villa\\'s large private collection may have once belonged to Julius Caesar\\'s father-in-law, Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus in the 1st century BC. Buried by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius that destroyed the town in 79 AD, it was rediscovered in 1752, around 1800 carbonized scrolls were found in the villa\\'s top story. Using modern techniques such as multi-spectral imaging, previously illegible or invisible sections on scrolls that have been unrolled are now being deciphered. It is possible that more scrolls remain to be found in the lower, unexcavated levels of the villa.\\n\\n\\n== Israel ==\\nThe Theological Library of Caesarea Maritima, a late 3rd century AD establishment, was a great early Christian library. Through Origen of Alexandria and the scholarly priest Pamphilus of Caesarea, the  school won a reputation for having the most extensive ecclesiastical library of the time, containing more than 30,000 manuscripts: Gregory of Nazianzus, Basil the Great, Jerome and others came to study there.\\n\\n\\n== Syria ==\\nEbla (2500 B.C. – 2250 B.C.)Constitute the oldest organized library yet discovered: see Ebla tablets.\\nUgarit (Modern Ras Shamra) (1200 B.C.)Several thousand texts consisting of diplomatic archives, census records, literary works and the earliest privately owned libraries yet recovered. Even though the tablets were written in several different languages, the most important aspect of the library were the 1400 texts written in a previously unknown tongue called Ugaritic.\\nTell Leilan (Northeast Syria) (1900 B.C.)This archive housed over a thousand clay tablets \\nMari (Modern Tell Hariri) (1900 B.C.)The archive held approximately 15,000 tablets which included works on litigation, letters, foreign negotiations, literary, and theological works \\nSufiya Mosque Library, Grand Umayyad Mosque (Aleppo) (12th Century)More than 10,000 volumes were housed in this library which were entrusted to the mosque by Prince Sayf al-Dawla.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nList of destroyed libraries\\nApellicon of Teos\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\nJohnson, Elmer D.
